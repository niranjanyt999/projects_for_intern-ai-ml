📧 Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
This project implements a spam detection system that classifies emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates end-to-end text classification using various preprocessing steps, feature extraction, and model evaluation.

🧠 Objective
To build a machine learning model that accurately classifies email messages as spam or not spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

📌 Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
NLTK
TF-IDF Vectorizer

🔍 Steps Involved
Data Loading
Import dataset (e.g., labeled emails).
Data Preprocessing
Lowercasing
Removing stopwords, punctuation
Tokenization
Lemmatization/Stemming (if applied)
Feature Extraction
Convert text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF
Model Training
Models: Naive Bayes / SVM / Logistic Regression
Splitting data into training and testing sets
Model Evaluation
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
Confusion Matrix
Prediction
Predict whether a new message is spam or ham

📊 Sample Output
python
Copy
Edit
Input: "Congratulations! You've won a free ticket."
Prediction: Spam

Input: "Can we meet tomorrow to discuss the project?"
Prediction: Ham
✅ Results
Accuracy: ~97% (example)

Model Used: Multinomial Naive Bayes (best for text classification)

Vectorizer: TF-IDF performed better than CountVectorizer
